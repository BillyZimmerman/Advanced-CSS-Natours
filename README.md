# Advanced-CSS-Natours Project via Udemy @ https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wmq3@XaDtuR2fL7IByix-iuf_1A1DOAILy01_M3tWboN9t_n_aVL05izYb1Ra8SEP_iyTyw==/

Finding this project to be full of great ideas, systems and organization!

Looking forward to working more with Sass and taking what I have learned from this and apply it to future projects.
